    abstract  = {Kaldi has become a very popular toolkit for automatic speech recognition, showing considerable improvements through the combination of hidden Markov models (HMM) and deep neural networks (DNN). However, in spite of its great performance for some languages (e.g. English, Italian, Serbian, etc.), the resources for Brazilian Portuguese (BP) are still quite limited. This work describes what appears to be the first attempt to create Kaldi-based scripts and baseline acoustic models for BP using Kaldi tools. Experiments were carried out for dictation tasks and a comparison to CMU Sphinx toolkit in terms of word error rate (WER) was performed. Results seem promising, since Kaldi achieved the absolute lowest WER of 4.75% with HMM-DNN and outperformed CMU Sphinx even when using Gaussian mixture models only.},

    abstract  = {In order to transmit data efficiently over an optical network, many routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithms have been proposed. This work presents a genetic algorithm that aims at solving the RWA problem, which consists of choosing the most suitable lightpath (i.e., a combination of a route and a wavelength channel) between a source-destination pair of nodes in all-optical networks. A comparison to some already known approaches in terms of blocking probability per load over four network topologies was made. Simulation results show a good performance, since the average blocking probability achieved by the proposed genetic algorithm was relatively equivalent to the values yielded by the standard approaches over two network topologies; and way lower on the other two networks.},
