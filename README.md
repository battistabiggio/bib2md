# parse_bib

This is a simple script that parses a bibtex file and generates the markdown
files for the [Hugo academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic). 

The script relies on
[bibtexparser](https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser) to get the
individual entries from the bibtex file with your publications and then
generates a .md file for each one of them under */content/publications/* and a
.bib file with the same name under *static/files/citations/*.

## Use

Simply download the script in your root website folder (e.g., next to the .toml
file), make sure that you have
[bibtexparser](https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser) installed and
run:
```
python parse_bib.py -i <inputfile>.bib
```
  
## Dependencies (Debian 9.9)
```
sudo apt-get install python3-bibtexparser
```
